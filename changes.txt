2/15/12 changes
+ added spacebar input to bots, makes interesting yet unlikely useful behaviour changes
+ New brain output: Choice. Replaces the weight of the last connection of each box with a value in the range 0-2 based on this output. It is hoped 
  that this will lead to more complex behaviours than ever before.
+ added "follow highest generation" function, follows bot with highest gen count. NOTE: this and "follow oldest" follow the same bot in the most 
  random batches of agents.
+ food spread introduced
+ food sharing indicator changed to temperature discomfort indicator: more orange means more health being lost
= Temperature preference now more likely to match the location where a random agent is placed, to help start populations
= experimentation with a recursive weight system, where when a conn's val is above 0.6, its weight is increased. Conversely, when it's below 0.3, its
  weight is decreased, by about 0.000001 both ways
= balancing adjustments to plant food
= optimizing of code and agent loops; mostly just experimentation.

1/1/2012 changes
- made many more variables per agent customizable and inheritable (such as eye sensitivity etc)
- added two more keys: 's' follows the selected agent around. 'o' follows the oldest agent around.
- number of carnivores and herbivores are now visualized on top of the world
- added a new type of brain: assembly brain, but it needs much more work. i.e. don't use

v1.3
- Fixed compilation issues on Linux
- Ported to CMake build system

v1.2 changes (released 19 January 2011):

- New Brain: DWRAON (Damped Weighted Recurrent AND/OR Network). This is better due to more continuous behavior than the old, discrete, rule based system.
- No dichotomy of herbivore/carnivore. There is a stomach specialization variable between 0,1. At 0, specialized to process plants, at 1, meat. This trait is inherited and undergoes mutation. This also supports emergence of omnivores, which can process both, to a lesser degree.
- Meat food is now only allocated when a creature dies, as opposed to when it is injured. It is distributed evenly to all nearby creatures when the kill occurs. This leads more clearly to emergence of hunting packs.
- Ability to judge health of an organism in front was added. I think of it something as a blood sensor. Essentially, it fires if something wounded is ahead. This can make agents become selective when hunting.
- More sensors were added: Two clock neurons that have time-varying activity at a some frequency that can be inherited. This is useful for introducing base activity into the brain, and also for giving agents a simple way to keep track of time, and do something at regular intervals. 
- Also, a hearing sensor was added that directly simulates sound. Agents can now shout at each other, but probably lack the capacity to temporally parse a shouting stream and create anything that resembles a non-trivial language.
- Sound generator actuator was added, which simulates creating sound and corresponds to shouting.
- Ability to share food was added. An agent can choose to give up its food to organisms around it. This potentially enables emergence of altruism: When a bot is too high in health, it may sense that there is one of its kind ahead that needs food, and choose to give it up.
